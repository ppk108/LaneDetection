# LaneDetection
Computer vision lane detection algorithm

Lane detection is an important application of computer vision. OpenCV can be used to detect and track the lanes on a road, which is essential for a self-driving car to stay within its lane and avoid collisions. In this algorithm, we will explore how OpenCV can be used to perform lane detection on an image of a road. We will use techniques such as Canny edge detection, Hough transform, and post-processing to identify the lanes and draw them on the input image.
